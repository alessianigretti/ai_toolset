# Finite State Machine
## The Theory
### What is it?
A Finite State Machine (FSM) is an abstract computational model used in computer science and AI to represent systems that can be in a finite number of states.
It consists of a set of states, transitions between these states, and actions associated with each state or transition.
The FSM operates by transitioning from one state to another based on specific inputs or events, allowing the system to exhibit different behaviors based on its current state.
### When should it be used?
FSMs are particularly useful when modeling systems or agents with a limited and well-defined set of states and behaviors.
They are commonly used in applications where the behavior of an entity can be represented as discrete states and where the transitions between states are relatively straightforward and deterministic.
FSMs are suitable for tasks like character movement in video games, simple control systems, and protocols with well-defined sequences of events.
### When should it not be used?
FSMs might not be the best choice for systems or agents with highly complex and dynamic behaviors.
If the number of states and transitions becomes unmanageable, the FSM can become cumbersome to design and maintain.
Additionally, if the transitions between states are not deterministic and depend on a large number of factors or require continuous adjustments,
other AI architectures like Behavior Trees or rule-based systems might be more appropriate.
### What are the common pitfalls of this approach?
Some common pitfalls of using FSMs include:
* State Explosion: If the number of states and transitions grows significantly, the FSM can become difficult to manage, leading to decreased readability and maintainability.
* Lack of Flexibility: FSMs can be inflexible when dealing with complex and fluid behaviors, as they require explicit state definitions for each behavior, making it challenging to handle nuanced decision-making.
* Complex State Logic: As the system becomes more complex, designing the transitions and state logic can become intricate and error-prone, leading to unintended or incorrect behaviors.
* Inefficient Handling of Concurrent Events: Traditional FSMs might struggle to handle concurrent or simultaneous events, as they are designed for discrete state transitions.
