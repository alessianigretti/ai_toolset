# Utility System
## The Theory
### What is it?
Utility AI is an artificial intelligence approach used to make decisions based on assigning utilities or scores to various actions or behaviors.
In Utility AI, each action or behavior is associated with a utility value that represents its desirability or usefulness in achieving a particular goal.
The AI agent selects the action with the highest utility score, allowing it to make rational decisions that maximize the expected outcome.
### When should it be used?
Utility AI is particularly useful in scenarios where there are multiple possible actions or behaviors, each contributing differently to the achievement of a goal.
It is well-suited for situations where decision-making involves complex trade-offs, and the agent needs to consider both short-term and long-term consequences.
### When should it not be used?
Utility AI might not be the best choice for tasks with straightforward decision-making or when actions do not have clear trade-offs.
If the problem domain involves only a few simple actions or when the complexity of assigning utility scores outweighs the benefits, other simpler AI techniques like rule-based systems or Finite State Machines might be more appropriate.
### What are the common pitfalls of this approach?
Some common pitfalls of using Utility AI include:
* Complexity in Utility Function: Designing the utility function that accurately reflects the agent's goals and preferences can be challenging. A poorly designed utility function may lead to suboptimal or irrational decisions.
* Scaling and Normalization: Ensuring that utility scores are properly scaled and normalized across various actions is crucial to maintain fairness and balance in decision-making.
* Local Optima: The agent may get stuck in local optima, selecting actions that provide immediate high utility but might not lead to the best long-term outcome.
* Computational Overhead: Calculating utilities for numerous actions can be computationally expensive, especially in complex environments with a large action space.
